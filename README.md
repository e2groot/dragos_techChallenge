# Introduction

This project is a standalone application with a simple HTTP API using
the libraries commonly used in Dragos Platform microservices.

Before starting, you may want to read up a little on...

1. [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), the Java-interoperable language
used for the production code
2. [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) (JVM implementation of
[ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/)), a library for composing asynchronous
and event-based programs by using observable sequences
3. [Ratpack](https://ratpack.io/), a lightweight, promise-based embedded
web server
4. [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/), the Java-interoperable language
used for the test code
5. [Spock](http://spockframework.org/), a Groovy-based testing and
mocking framework
6. [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), a Groovy-based build tool

# IDE

You are free to use any IDE you'd like, but an up-to-date version of
IntelliJ Community Edition supports Kotlin and Groovy syntax, as well as
Spock and Gradle, out of the box.

# Build

From the root of the repository run `./gradlew clean build` (Mac/Linux)
or `gradlew.bat clean build` (Windows) to build the project. This will
download the correct version of Gradle to a cache in your home directory
and execute the `clean` and `build` tasks. Note that until the bugs in
the project are fixed, the build will fail during the `test` task.

# Assignment Instructions

Perform each task in it's own branch (you can branch off another branch
if desired). Upon finishing each task, submit a pull request using the
BitBucket UI and add [Jon Peterson](jpeterson@dragos.com) and [Joe
Percivall](jpercivall@dragos.com) as reviewers.

### Tasks

1. **Fix a bug where a new customer is being created even when the
   requester has insufficient privileges.**
    * Each of the "try to create with..." tests will pass when this is
      fixed.

2. **Fix a bug where new customers are being created with duplicate
   IDs.**
    * The "create many" test will pass when this is fixed.

3. **Implement caching to improve performance when getting privileges
   for an auth token.**
    * When implemented, the "create many" test should complete in a few
      seconds.

4. **Bonus: Implement an alternate CustomerRepository that persists
   customers data.**
    * Can be to flat file(s), a database, etc.

### Hints

If you get stuck for a while on a bug fix and need a point in the right
direction, [Jon Peterson](jpeterson@dragos.com) or [Joe Percivall](
jpercivall@dragos.com) can provide hints.
